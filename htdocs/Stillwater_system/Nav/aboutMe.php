            <p>These may include art, furniture, jewelry, books, rugs, clothing, or any item that has survived the ravages of time. While some dealers earn specific titles and specialize in one type of relic, many are generalists who examine pieces of any type with historic, aesthetic, and financial value. “It is difficult to describe the life of an antiques dealer,” wrote one of our respondents, “because it involves so many things. </p>

            <h3>Paying Your Dues</h3>
            <p><span class="number">2</span></p>
            <p>A variety of undergraduate degrees lend themselves to this career path, but no specific major is required. Art history majors enjoy the interaction with beautiful works; business students appreciate the investment and dealing aspects of the profession; history majors love the continuous education the job allows. Becoming an antiques dealer requires spending long hours inspecting pieces, visiting other antiques dealers, reviewing documentation, and researching histories. Most aspiring antiques dealers begin as interns at auction houses or alongside established professionals and learn as assistants, take care of correspondence, make research trips to the library, and schedule appointments.</p>

            <p><span class="number">3</span></p>
            <p>Beginning in the seventeenth century, though, craftsmanship emerged as the favorite means of wealthy home beautification, and this demand spurred the production of high-quality, aesthetically pleasing pieces of furniture. Within 70 years, these pieces were being sold as antiques or specialty items. Antique sales tend to be even more active during years of financial lassitude. Those who aspire to become part of this industry should understand that most successful antiques dealers have to have a critical mass of audience (that is, a client base) to make the profession selfsupporting. </p>
